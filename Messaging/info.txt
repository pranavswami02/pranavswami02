This is a messaging web app that I have created. It uses firebase, an online Real Time Database, to store the messages on an online database. It uses the languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The webpage is online at the url: rishavb123.github.io/Messaging OR go to rishavb123.github.io and click the Messaging link
