The is a python program that is meant to remind you to drink water. It will send an email telling you to drink water with an image every 3 hours between 6 AM to 10 PM. Another part of this program is that it keeps reading a google spreadsheet which is linked to a form. Because of this, you can use the form to send a reminder in the form of an email with a custom message and it will send in the number of minutes that u set while entering the form. The link to the form is in every email. Of course, you have to enter a password to verify that you have permission to send this remind. So the google forms part and the emailing every three hours parts are threaded together so that they are both running at the same time in one program without taking up too much proccessing power. For all of this to be working, you need to have the python file running.

This can be done by running Main.py or running run.bat with python installed as an environmental variable on your computer.
