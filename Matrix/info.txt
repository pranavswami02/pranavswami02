This is a cool effect that I have creating using a canvas element in html. It is the effect of the matrix code. After you clicked on the screen, the code will fall apart and start bouncing on certain boundries. As this happens, the text you entered when the page loaded will start to appear. After this animation, there is a matrix themed snake game where the letters make up the snake and the red letters are the apples.
